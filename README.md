## Pipelined-Processor-Sim
### C++ code to simulate pipelined processor

The processor is implemented using a 5-stage pipeline, using the Instruction Cache, Data Cache and Register Cache, reading the contents from a file. <br>
To determine if a paritcular instruction is to be fetched, stalled or executed, flag bits are used and updated dynamically as the program is executed. <br>
The changes made to the Data Cache and Register Cache are finally written onto the files.
